DevOps can help organizations:

DevOps can help ensure that software is more reliable and of higher quality.
Respond to customer needs

DevOps practices include: 
Continuous delivery: A process for consistently and reliably deploying applications into production environments. 
Continuous integration: A process that includes automated testing to help ensure the quality and reliability of software and infrastructure updates. 
Monitoring and logging: A process that verifies performance in real time. 
Automation: A process that can help manage development, testing, and production. 
DevOps originated as a hashtag around 2007, and has since grown into a cultural movement in IT.
